# Java-Full-Stack
- What is difference between programming Language, Technology and Framework?
    - **Programming Language:**
        - These are directly installable S/W as raw materials and provide basic features of application development.
        - These languages defines syntaxes(rules) and semantics(structure) of programming by giving compliers and interperters
        - These are base to create S/W technologies, frameworks, DB S/W , Operating Systems , Tools and etc..
        - **These are like rice grains , if we generate rice grains it takes a lot of process .**
        - **Examples:** c, c++,c#.
    - **S/W Technology:**
        - It is a software specification providing rules and guidelines to vender companies to create implementation softwares by using one or another programming language.
        - Software technologies are not installable , but software technologies based implementation S/W arrangble or installable and working them is nothing but working software technologies.
        - **Examples:JDBC,Servlet,JMS,etc..**
            - ⇒ JDBC technology provides set of rules and guidelines to create JDBC Driver software using java language.
            - Working with JDBC driver S/W is nothing but working with JDBC Technology.
            - API ⇒ In java, API packages having classes, Interfaces , enums and annoations.
            - **Technology API Gives**
                - Interfaces→ Representing rules
                - Concreate classes → Representing guidelines
                - abstract classes → Representing both rules and guidelines.
            - From onward Java 8
                - Interfaces also represent both rules and guidelines.

        - Since all vendor companies are giving implementation S/W’s by based on common rules and guidelines S/W technology.. so the knowledge working with one implementation S/W can be used to work with other implementation..
            - Framework:
            When developing Java applications using only technologies and languages, developers must write both common and application-specific logic themselves—similar to constructing a house from scratch. This increases the programmer's workload.
            - However, when using frameworks, developers only need to write application-specific logic. The framework automatically generates common logic internally using various technologies, which significantly reduces the programmer's burden.- Similiar House purchase from Real Estate Builder
